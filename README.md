### Hierarchy Coordinates

A package for calculation of hierarchy coordinates of networks, as originally formulated exclusively for unweighted directed
networks<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> by [Corominas-Murta et al. (2013)][0.1] in _On the Origins of Hierarchy in Complex Networks_,
and subsequently implemented in Matlab v7, this package provides a python3 implementation which includes weighted networks. 

Hierarchy coordinates describe a network in terms of its treeness, orderability, and feedforwardness (TFO coordinates),
which collectively describe the relevant aspects of hierarchy for many networks. Below is an illustration by [Corominas-Murta et al. (2013)][0.1] 
of the hierarchy morphospace with example networks illustrated for accessible coordinates. 
![Abstracted Hierarchy coordinate space, with example networks for each theoretically accessible region of the
morphospace](readme_docs/Hierarchy_Coordinate_Space.png)

There are a variety of functions required for the calculation of hierarchy coordinates, including initially reducing a simple,
directed graph into a node weighted Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), and thereafter making use of:
_max_min_layers_, *(recursive)_leaf_removal*, *graph_entropy*, and the base hierarchy coordinate functions<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup>.
Naturally all may be used independently, or for the common purpose of simply finding the hierarchy coordinates of a given graph
(including a binary graph, for which the thresholds are not used) one may simply use _hierarchy_coordinates.average_hierarchy_coordinates_,
as in this example code:
```
import numpy as np
import hierarchy_coordinates as hc

Adjacency_Matrix = np.random.rand(10, 10)
orderability, feedforwardness, treeness = hc.average_hierarchy_coordinates(Adjacency_Matrix)
```

Another graphic by [Corominas-Murta et al. (2013)][0.1] provides a rough notion of the corresponding calculation:

Calculation of hierarchy coordinates for weighted networks are performed simply by reducing weighted networks to a set of 
unweighted networks based on either exponentially or linearly distributed thresholds, and subsequently averaging their 
hierarchy coordinates as given by the original algorithm described in their [appendix][0.3].
